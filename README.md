# [IteadOS SDK](https://github.com/iteadsw/SDK)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
# What Is It?
 
IteadOS SDK offers junior developers with underlying hardware operation 
interfaces based on Linux. Simplifying the hardware operation makes it possible 
for software engineers who are not familiar with the underlying hardware 
and junior developers to understand more about "Code World" and 
"Physical World". It can also work as a rapid prototyping development tool.
 
The SDK's API, which is similar to Arduino, make it easier for those who have 
some understanding of Arduino. Moreover, with the SDK, Python users can operate
the underlying hardware more easily.
 
 
# What Can It Do?

At present, IteadOS SDK holds the following features making it possible for users
to manipulate hardwares such as GPIO,UART,SPI,I2C etc. Based on those, users can 
control directly a mass of Shields(or Modules for a specific purpose) such as 
GSM,1602LCD, OLED etc. Importantly, IteadOS SDK gets its popular with supporting
more and more Shields and Hardware Platforms. Additionally, IteadOS SDK provides
most of Arduino API. Your sketches run perfectly with or without few changes.

- ibox
- Raspberry Pi Rv2 
 
If you don't know yet Iteaduino Plus or ibox, see 
<http://imall.iteadstudio.com/iteaduino-plus-a20.html/> and
<http://imall.iteadstudio.com/ibox.html/>
 
More platforms will be supported as soon as possible.


# Installation and Uninstallation

Before all, we assume that you have installed the required packages:
`make build-essential git-core` in your debian system. If not, you can install
them by command:
 
    $ sudo apt-get install make build-essential git-core
 
## Download and Install SDK in Debian

Only a few steps, DO IT !

### Step 1: Getting the Source Code

You can download SDK by command:

    $ git clone https://github.com/iteadsw/SDK.git
    $ cd SDK

Or you can get SDK via other ways you prefer at <https://github.com/iteadsw/SDK>

***Note: All the commands of the fellowing steps should be run under SDK's 
source code directory.***

### Step 2: Configuration Your Board

For now, platforms supported by SDK and the configuration commands are below. 
You **MUST** choose the one fitting your board.

- Iteaduino Plus A10/A20 and ibox
        
        $ make Iteaduino_Plus

- Raspberry Pi Rv2

        $ make Raspberry_Rv2

### Step 3: Select Functional Libraries to Install (Optional)

**If you want to install all the libraries, just skip this step.**

It's allowed for user to select functional libraries to install. Open file
`config.mk` and edit it by **adding or removing letter "#"** at the head of each
line for **unselecting or selecting** the corresponding library. More 
description for selecting libraries can be found in `config.mk`. For example:

    $ vi config.mk
    Editing... and Save

### Step 4: Compile and Install

Installing SDK requires root(super user)'s previlege. Run command:

    $ make
    $ sudo make install

## Version and Help

To check the version of SDK installed, run command:
    
    $ iteadcompile -v
    
For some brief help information:

    $ iteadcompile --help

## Uninstall

To uninstall the SDK, just run command:

    $ cd SDK
    $ sudo make uninstall
    
# How to Use

**SDK works well with C(.c) and C++(.cpp) programs. Especially, it is 
compatiable with Arduino Sketch(.ino).**

## To use SDK in C program

Create a new file named "led.c" which reads as follow:

    #include <itead.h>
    #include <stdio.h>
    
    #define STATUS_LED1 PIN_PH21
 
    void setup(void)
    {
        printf("setup begin\n");
        pinMode(STATUS_LED1,OUTPUT);
    }
    void loop(void)
    {
        digitalWrite(STATUS_LED1,HIGH);
        delay(1000);
        digitalWrite(STATUS_LED1,LOW);
        delay(1000);
    }
    void main(int argc, char **argv)
    {
        setup();
        while(1)
        {
            loop();
        }
    }

Then run iteadcompile in the terminal

    $ iteadcomile LED led.c

You can run the LED program after compilation:

    $ sudo ./LED


## To use SDK in C++ program
 
Create a new file named "led.cpp" which reads as follow:

    #include <itead.h>
    #include <stdio.h>
 
    #define STATUS_LED1 PIN_PH21
 
    void setup(void)
    {
        printf("setup begin\n");
        pinMode(STATUS_LED1,OUTPUT);
    }
    void loop(void)
    {
        digitalWrite(STATUS_LED1,HIGH);
        delay(1000);
        digitalWrite(STATUS_LED1,LOW);
        delay(1000);
    }
    int main(int argc, char **argv)
    {
        setup();
        while(1)
        {
            loop();
        }
        return 0;
    }
    
Then run iteadcompile in the terminal
 
    $ iteadcomile LED led.cpp
 
You can run the LED program after compilation:

    $ sudo ./LED

 
## To use SDK like an Arduino sketch(.ino)

Create a new file named "led.ino" which contains the fellowing lines:

    #include <stdio.h>
    
    #define STATUS_LED1 PIN_PH21
 
    void setup(void)
    {
        printf("setup begin\n");
        pinMode(STATUS_LED1,OUTPUT);
    }
    void loop(void)
    {
        digitalWrite(STATUS_LED1,HIGH);
        delay(1000);
        digitalWrite(STATUS_LED1,LOW);
        delay(1000);
    }

Then run command as below to compile led.ino:

    $ iteadcompile LED led.ino

You can run the LED program after compilation:

    $ sudo ./LED

### Note: How to understand debug information from compiler

You DO NOT include the itead.h explicitly in your source file with suffex .ino.
iteacompile will take care of everything. That means you need to know the method
you should use for locating your .ino sketch bugs. Actually,if you have a sketch
named "Hello.ino" with a bug at level ERROR in line 25, you will get some ERROR 
informations telling the ERROR bug in "Hello.cpp" with line 26(25+1) when 
command "iteadcompile Hello Hello.ino" is executed. Why? iteacompile insert one 
line like _include  "itead.h"_  in the head of your Hello.ino, change the suffex
.ino to .cpp and compile(using g++) Hello.cpp to generate Hello which is 
executable binary file. When you encounter other bugs in your sketch,debug 
skills on C++ program will also helpful for solving your porblems.


# For more help

Please find in project wiki at <http://wiki.iteadstudio.com/Itead_SDK>. With 
more and more hardware that it supports, wiki will also be updated accordingly.

# Raspberry Rv2 GPIO Pin Number Map

In IteadOS SDK, Raspberry Rv2 GPIO in number is identical to PCB Connector's 
number order. In others words, Connector P1 covers GPIO pin number 1-26 with 
P1's first pin corresponding to GPIO pin number 1. Specially, Connector P5 
covers GPIO pin number 27-34 with P5's first pin corresponding to GPIO pin 
number 27.


# Dynamic Library(.so file) Catalogue

Python users need to know the specific installation locations of the
following dynamic libraries when they use the SDK:
 
* libiteadc.so(core c language dynamic library):/usr/lib, /usr/local/lib
* libiteadcpp.so(core c++ dynamic library):/usr/lib, /usr/local/lib
* libiteadmodule.so(all the c++ modules library):/usr/lib, /usr/local/lib

# Dependency

* Platform :Allwinner A10/A20 SoC
* Kernel verson: linux-sunxi-3.4
<https://github.com/linux-sunxi/linux-sunxi>
* Kernel make configure
file:<https://github.com/iteadsw/SDK/blob/master/tools/iteaduino_plus_a10_defconfig>
and <https://github.com/iteadsw/SDK/blob/master/tools/iteaduino_plus_a20_defconfig>
* FEX file:<https://github.com/iteadsw/SDK/blob/master/tools/iteaduino_plus_a10.fex>
