# IteadOS SDK
## What Is It?
 
 
IteadOS SDK is customized offers junior developers with underlying
hardware operation interfaces. It can simplify the hardware operation,
which is a way for software engineers who are not familiar with the
underlying hardware and junior developers to know about "Code World" and
"Physical World"; it can also work as a rapid prototyping development tool.
 
IteadOS SDK supports Iteaduino Plus and ibox. For details of the
hardware, you can refer to <http://imall.iteadstudio.com/ibox.html/> and
<http://imall.iteadstudio.com/iteaduino-plus-a20.html/>
 
The operating functions similar to Arduino offered by the SDK make it
easier for those who have some understanding of Arduino. Moreover, with
the SDK, Python users can operate the underlying hardware more easily.
 
The SDK can also be applied in others development boards which adopt the
same chip (Allwinner A10/A20) such pcDuino, Marsboard, Cubieboard, etc.
 
## What Can It Do?
 
* Support for simple GPIO operation
* Support for GPIO 8-bit / 16-bit bus operations
* Support for simple UART operations
* Support for simple upper-layer time operation functions
* Support for IIC bus operations
* Support for SPI bus operations
* Support for SSD1306-based IIC interfaced OLED screen operations
* Support for LCD1602 LCD in 4-bit mode
* More libraries are being developed
 
Up to 9th, Apr., 2014, the SDK has been added with support for GPIO,
TWI, SPI, UART and supplied with libraries of LCD1602, SSD1306 OLED,
etc. With various API's at bus interface, users can easily operate
UART,SPI and IIC devices; while with API's on the modules, users can use
the functions in the library directly to control OLED screen for display
and the same to LCD1602.
 
## Dependency
* Platform :Allwinner A10/A20 SoC
* Kernel verson: linux-sunxi-3.4
<https://github.com/linux-sunxi/linux-sunxi>
* Kernel make configure
file:<https://github.com/iteadsw/SDK/blob/master/tools/iteaduino_plus_a10_defconfig>
and <https://github.com/iteadsw/SDK/blob/master/tools/iteaduino_plus_a20_defconfig>
* FEX file:<https://github.com/iteadsw/SDK/blob/master/tools/iteaduino_plus_a10.fex>
and <https://github.com/iteadsw/SDK/blob/master/tools/iteaduino_plus_a20.fex>
 
Users of Iteaduino Plus A10/A20 can directly download and install the
latest system img and SDK; users of other platforms are recommended to
use make configure provided to compile 3.4 kernel and apply the fex file
offered.
 
## Dynamic Library(.so file) Catalogue:
Python users need to know the specific installation locations of the
following dynamic libraries when they use the SDK:
 
* libiteadc.so(core c language dynamic library):/usr/lib, /usr/local/lib
* libiteadcpp.so(core c++ dynamic library):/usr/lib, /usr/local/lib
* libiteadmodule.so(all the c++ modules library):/usr/lib, /usr/local/lib
 
## How to Install
 
Take debian as example:
 
    git clone https://github.com/iteadsw/SDK.git
    cd SDK
    make
    sudo make install
 
Note: We assume that you have installed the
make/build-essential/git-core packages in your debian system.
 
## How to Use
 
Tak an simple C program as example.
 
Creat a new file named "led.ino" which reads as follwo:
 
    #include <stdio.h>
 
    #define STATUS_LED1 PIN_PH21
 
    void setup(void)
    {
        printf("setup begin\n");
        pinMode(STATUS_LED1,OUTPUT);
    }
    void loop(void)
    {
        digitalWrite(STATUS_LED1,HIGH);
        delay(1000);
        digitalWrite(STATUS_LED1,LOW);
        delay(1000);
    }
 
Then run iteadcompile in the terminal
 
    iteadcomile LED led.ino
 
You can run the LED program after compilation.
 
For more details, please find in project wiki. With more and more
hardware that it supports, wiki will also be updated accordingly.
 
## Plan for Next Stage
 
* Provide more API for user's application
* Support more hardware platform, such as Raspberry PI
 
 
## How to Contribute
 
If you are interested and want to contribute to this project, yet you
are suffering from lack of the related hardware. It does not matter.
Just write an E-mail to <info@iteadstudio.com>, attach your github
username in it and say something about your experience on the related
projects, Itead Studio will send you a hardware for free after approval.
 
After receiving Iteaduino Plus A10/A20, you only need to:
